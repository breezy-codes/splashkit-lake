# SplashKit Lake

**SplashKit Lake** is a repository for intermediate-stage games developed with the SplashKit SDK. This repository serves as a collection of games that have moved beyond the experimental phase in **[SplashKit Pond](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-pond)** and are undergoing further refinement, testing, and improvements. Once these games are fully polished and stable, they can progress to **[SplashKit Beach](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-beach)** for stable release and public enjoyment.

## Purpose

SplashKit Lake provides a space for games that are more mature than experimental projects but still require some additional work before they are ready for public deployment. Games here may have completed core features but are in the process of being tested, balanced, and enhanced to ensure a quality player experience.

## Repository Structure

Games within SplashKit Lake are organized as individual folders in this repository. Each folder contains a specific game, including all necessary files and resources. This structure allows developers to work on each game independently while keeping them accessible for testing and review. When a game in SplashKit Lake reaches a high level of polish and stability, it can be promoted to **[SplashKit Beach](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-beach)** for public enjoyment.

## Getting Started

To play or test the games in SplashKit Lake, you’ll need to install the SplashKit SDK. Follow the [SplashKit Installation Guide](http://www.splashkit.io/installation/) to set up your environment.

## Notes

Please note that while games in SplashKit Lake are more refined than those in SplashKit Pond, they may still undergo updates and adjustments. For information on controls, setup, and specific gameplay details, refer to the README files within each game’s folder.
